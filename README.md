# What Could Go Wrong - LLM Edition

This repository hosts the files used for the What Could Go Wrong? digital card game. Nikolas Martelaro and Wendy Ju developed and presented the game at a Workshop at AutoUI 2020. The game was then modified by Nik and his team at CMU to be more generalized for AI-based systems.

The version here presents a further iteration on the game. In this iteration, prompts focus on applications of large language models. Example applications are drawn from two sources: Kaddour et al.(2023) and FlowGPT.com. The list of potential ethical issues stems from the AI4People framework (Floridi et al., 2021) and a business ethics enumeration (Baker and Comer, 2012). Besides, this iteration of the game includes a LaTeX template, which can be used to convert the digital card game into a physical card game. 

The digital card game can be loaded into and played on PlayingCards.io. Custom cards can be added using the `csv` files for `prompts` and `responses`

## Abstract
While autonomous vehicles have the potential to greatly improve our daily lives, there are also challenges and potential downsides to these systems. In this workshop, we intend to foster discussions about the potential negative aspects of autonomous cars in hopes of surfacing challenges that should be considered during the design process rather than after deployment. We will spur these conversations through a review of participant position statements and through group discussion facilitated by a card game called “What Could Go Wrong?” Our goal is to consider the autonomous vehicle’s benefits—improving safety, increasing mobility, reducing emissions—against potential drawbacks. By identifying potential harms and downsides, the workshop attendees, and the AutoUI community more broadly can design well-considered solutions.

## Game Setup Instructions
1. Download this repository
2. Go to https://playingcards.io/game/standard-deck to start a custom deck
3. Enter the virtual card table
4. Click the `Edit Table` icon in the green toolbard
5. Select `Room Options`
6. Select  `Import From File`
7. Upload `what-could-go-worng-av.pcio`
8. Click `Edit Table` to exit editing mode and go into gameplay mode

## Gameplay Instructions with Wildcard Round Integration

1. All players draw 5 white cards from their stack.
2. Click the spinner to determine the first player to become the Card Czar.
3. If a player either do not know the definition of the word mentionned on the prompt card or thinks there can be a confusion on the meaning of this word, this player tell others and : 
  a. If every other players have the same definition in mind : explain it to the player who did not know and continue the game (go to fifth point of instructions).
	b. If the other players disagree on the right definition : the whole team debate on the right definition to adopt.
	c. If people disagree, the Card Czar decide it.
4. All other players then put 1 white response card face down in their slot.
5. **Introducing the Wildcard Round**: At a predetermined point in the game, players are allowed to play two white cards instead of one, introducing a dynamic element of strategy. This round allows for the potential to earn double points if both cards are selected by the Card Czar, encouraging deeper thought in card selection and synergy.

- **Activation**: The Wildcard Round is introduced at a specific, pre-announced point in the game, such as after every third round, to inject a refreshing twist.
- **Dual Play**: During this round, players are permitted to select two white cards from their hand instead of the standard single card. This challenges players to think strategically about card combinations that will resonate with the prompt and with each other.
- **Double Points Opportunity**: If the Card Czar selects a player’s combination as the most compelling, that player earns double points for the round. This raises the stakes and encourages players to engage more deeply with both the prompt and their cards.

6. The Card Czar reveals all submitted white cards, reading each aloud. They then select the card(s) that they find most fitting or humorous in relation to the black prompt card. +1 point (+2 in case of both the two submitted cards are chosen in wildcard round) goes to the player whose card was chosen.
7. The chosen white card sparks a group discussion, allowing players to explore further implications or humorous takes on the scenario.
8. The group engages in an extended discussion on what else could go wrong based on the chosen card. Participants can award +1 point to anyone who contributes a compelling point during the discussion.
9. After the discussion concludes, a new Card Czar is chosen via the spinner, and the "Deal" button is pressed. This ensures each player draws up to 5 cards again, preparing for the next round.

### During the game
1. Take notes on ideas that you have not thought about before
2. Some of the cards are causes, others are effects. Don’t worry about what the game designers intended with each card, go where the discussion is best.
3. Some of the cards may be upsetting. (Such as, a person is abused.)
4. It’s fine to take time to have discussion.
5. Try not to get side tracked, though!
