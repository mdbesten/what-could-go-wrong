# What Could Go Wrong? - LLM Edition

### Gameplay Instructions

**Getting Started:**
* The game is designed for 3 or more players.
* Each player needs a stack of event cards (marked with the reply icon ðŸ”„) and a way to track points (pen and paper or a scoring system).

**Gameplay:**
1. **Deal Cards:** Each player draws 5 event cards and keeps them face down.
2. **Choose the Card Czar:** Determine the first player (e.g., roll a die). This player becomes the Card Czar.
3. **Draw a Prompt Card:** The Card Czar draws a single prompt card (marked with the tasks icon ðŸ“‹) and reads it aloud.
4. **Play Event Cards:** Each player selects one event card from their hand that best relates to the prompt and places it face down on the table.
5. **Reveal and Discuss:** The Card Czar collects all event cards, shuffles them, and reveals them one by one, reading aloud. 
6. **Choose the Winning Event Card:** The Card Czar selects the event card they find most interesting or relevant to the prompt. The player who played that card scores 1 point.
7. **Group Discussion:** Discuss the prompt and the chosen event card. Players can earn bonus points for insightful comments or ideas.
8. **Start a New Round:** After discussion, the next player becomes the Card Czar, and a new round begins. Players replenish their hands to 5 cards.

**Winning:**
* There is no set number of rounds. Players can continue playing as long as desired. The player with the most points at the end wins.

**Tips:**
* Be creative with card choices.
* Encourage humor and silliness.
* Engage in thoughtful discussion.
* Listen to others' ideas and be respectful.
