        \item All players draw 5 event cards (\faicon{reply}) from their stack
        \item Throw the dice to choose the first player who will be the Card Czar.
        \item The Card Czar then pulls a prompt card (\faicon{tasks}) and reads it to the group
        \item All other players then put 1 event card face down on the table.   
        \item The Card Czar then flips and reads each white card out loud.
        \item The Card Czar then picks one of the event cards to further discuss. +1 point goes to the player whose card was chosen.
        \item The group then discusses further what else could go wrong based on the chosen card. People can award +1 point anyone who makes a good point in discussion.
        \item After the discussion dissipates after a few minutes, another player becomes the Card Czar based on the throw of a dice. Each player then draws a new white card, so that they again have 5 cards in their hand.
