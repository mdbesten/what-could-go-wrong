    \item Some of the cards may be upsetting. (Such as, a person is abused.)
    \item It’s fine to take time to have discussion, but discussions should not last more than 10 minutes to ensure a good flow.

    	\item The game can be both played in "quick-play" mode or "long-discussion" mode; each of these modes involve different settings.
     	\item The "quick-play" mode will be more adapted for a few players.
        \item All players draw 5 event cards (\faicon{reply}) from their stack
	\item To ensure a better clarity, cards have different colors : red cards are causes, blue cards are effects cards. 
 	\item Prompts are organized into thematic categories (e.g., healthcare, environment, public services...).
        \item Throw the dice to choose the first player who will be the Card Czar.
        \item The Card Czar then pulls a prompt card (\faicon{tasks}) and reads it to the group
        \item All other players then put 1 event card face down on the table.   
        \item The Card Czar then flips and reads each white card out loud.
        \item The Card Czar then picks one of the event cards to further discuss. +1 point goes to the player whose card was chosen.
        \item The group then discusses further what else could go wrong based on the chosen card. People can award +1 point anyone who makes a good point in discussion.
	\item The group's discussion for each round cannot exceed a certain time: 10 minutes for "long-discussion" mode, 5 minutes for "quick-play", to ensure a good flow.
        \item After the discussion dissipates after a few minutes, another player becomes the Card Czar based on the throw of a dice. Each player then draws a new white card, so that they again have 5 cards in their hand.
	\item After each round, the new Card Czar needs to mix the deck to ensure a good balance between causes and effects.
 	\item The game ends when a player reaches : 8 points for "long-discussion" mode, 5 points for "quick-play" mode.
