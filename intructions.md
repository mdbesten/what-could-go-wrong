What Could Go Wrong? - Gameplay Instructions

Getting Started

This game is designed for 3 or more players.
Each player should have a stack of event cards (marked with the reply icon üîÑ), challenge cards (marked with the exclamation icon ‚ùó), and a way to keep track of points (pen and paper or a scoring system).
Gameplay

Deal Cards: All players draw 5 event cards and 1 challenge card from their respective stacks and keep them face down.

Choose the Card Czar: Roll a die to see who goes first. This player becomes the Card Czar.

Draw a Prompt Card: The Card Czar draws a single prompt card (marked with the tasks icon üìã) and reads it aloud to the group.

Play Event and Challenge Cards: Silently, each player chooses one event card and one challenge card from their hand that they think best relates to the prompt and places them face down on the table.

Reveal and Discuss: The Card Czar collects all the event and challenge cards, shuffles them (to hide who played which card), and then reveals them one at a time, reading each card aloud.

Choose the Winning Event Card: The Card Czar picks the event card they find most interesting or funny in relation to the prompt. The player who played that card scores 1 point.

Vote for Bonus Points: After the winning event card is chosen, all players vote anonymously for their favorite response (excluding their own). The player with the most votes earns 1 bonus point.

Group Discussion: The group discusses the prompt and the chosen event card, as well as the challenges introduced by the challenge cards. What other potential consequences could arise from the situation? Players can award bonus points to each other for insightful comments or interesting ideas that add to the discussion.

New Round: After a few minutes of discussion, a new round begins. The Card Czar role passes to the next player (moving clockwise). Everyone draws new event and challenge cards to bring their hand back up to 5 cards each.

Winning

There is no set amount of rounds to play. You can continue playing for as long as you like! The player with the most points at the end is the winner.
